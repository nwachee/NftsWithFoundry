# NftsWithFoundry
Learning NFTs the fun way

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/nwachee/NftsWithFoundry.git
cd NftsWithFoundry
forge build
```

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Testing
```
forge test
```

or

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

 ### Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.


#### 1. **Setup environment variables**

Create a ```.env``` file in the root folder:

```bash
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

**NOTE: FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A PRIVATE KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.**

##### 2. **Deploy (IPFS NFT)**

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

##### 3. **Deploy (SVG NFT)**

```
make deploySvg ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Scripts

After deploy to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts. 

Using cast deployed locally example: 

```
cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

```
make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Base64

To get the base64 of an image, you can use the following command:

```
echo "data:image/svg+xml;base64,$(base64 -i ./images/dynamicNft/happy.svg)"
```

Then, you can get the base64 encoding of the json object by placing the imageURI into `happy_image_uri.json` then running:

```
echo "data:application/json;base64,$(base64 -i ./images/dynamicNft/happy_image_uri.json)"
```


## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see and output file called `.gas-snapshot`


# Formatting


To run code formatting:
```
forge fmt
```


# Thank you!
